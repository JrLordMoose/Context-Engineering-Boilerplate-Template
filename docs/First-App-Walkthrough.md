## 📁 **Phase 3: Create Your App Files** (10 minutes)

### Build Your Actual App

**What You'll Do**: Create files in your app folder using AI's generated code

**Your App Folder**: `Desktop/My Projects/my-first-app/` (remember - this is separate from template!)

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Review AI's output**: AI will provide something like:
   ```
   Create these files in your project:
   - index.html (HTML code provided)
   - style.css (CSS code provided)  
   - script.js (JavaScript code provided)
   - README.md (setup instructions provided)
   ```

2. **For each file AI specifies**:
   - **Right-click** in your `my-first-app/` folder
   - **Select**: "New" → "Text Document" (Windows) or "New Document" (Mac)
   - **Name it**: Exactly as AI specified (e.g., "index.html")
   - **Open the file**: Double-click to open
   - **Copy AI's code**: For that specific file
   - **Paste**: Into the file
   - **Save**: Ctrl+S

3. **Repeat**: For every file AI specified

**✅ Result**: Your `my-first-app/` folder contains all the code files

### Run Your App

**Follow AI's instructions**: AI provides setup instructions in the generated README.md

**Common examples**:
- **Simple web app**: Open index.html in your browser
- **Node.js app**: Follow npm install and npm start instructions
- **Python app**: Follow pip install and python app.py instructions

**✅ Final Result**: Working application you built with AI!

## 🚀 **Build Your Second App**

**Now that you understand the process**:
1. **Create**: `My Projects/my-second-app/` (new empty folder)
2. **Reference**: Same template in Downloads
3. **Copy**: Same 3 prompts (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 Enhanced)
4. **Build**: New app in new folder

**Each app gets its own folder. Template stays in Downloads for reference.**
