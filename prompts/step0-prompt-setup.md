       process=[
           "Assess project complexity and scope",
           "Identify technology stack and architectural patterns",
           "Determine optimal framework sophistication level"
       ],
       output="Framework recommendation with rationale"
   }
   ```

## üö® CRITICAL: File Placement Instructions

**Before providing configuration files, remind the user of correct file placement:**

### Where to Save Generated Files

**‚úÖ CORRECT Structure** (user's project folder):
```
~/Projects/my-project-name/         # User's project folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                       # Generated config (ROOT level)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context-sources.md              # Generated sources (ROOT level)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/subagents/              # Generated agents (subdirectory)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [Step 3 files will go here]    # Future app files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [All other project files]      # User's application
```

**‚ùå WRONG Locations** (prevent these mistakes):
```
# Don't put files here:
.claude/claude.md                   # ‚ùå Hidden in subdirectory
Context-Engineering-Template/       # ‚ùå In template folder
config/CLAUDE.md                    # ‚ùå In config subdirectory
```

**Essential Rule**: All Context Engineering files go in the PROJECT ROOT (same level as package.json, README.md, src/ folder).

## Ready to Begin

Please start by analyzing my project information and recommending the optimal Context Engineering framework level. Then generate the complete configuration files optimized for my specific project needs.

**Important**: When providing files, include clear instructions for where to save each file in the user's project directory.
