       step_by_step_resolution="Clear action plan for problem resolution",
       prevention_guidance="How to avoid this issue in future",
       workflow_recovery="How to get back on track efficiently"
   }
   ```

5. **Recovery Strategy Planning**:
   - **Quick Fix**: Immediate solution to continue current workflow
   - **Reset Strategy**: When to restart from a specific step
   - **Enhancement Approach**: How to improve workflow for better results
   - **Prevention Protocol**: Avoid similar issues in future

## Common Issue Categories & Solutions

### Category 1: Context Continuity Problems

**Issue**: Lost context between steps, AI doesn't remember previous work
**Diagnosis**: Context not properly carried forward between workflow steps
**Solution**:
```markdown
Immediate Fix:
1. If in same chat: Ask AI "Please refer to our previous conversation about [project name]"
2. If new chat: Copy complete previous step outputs into new conversation
3. Use Context Builder utility to avoid this issue in future

Prevention: Complete all steps in single chat session OR use Context Builder utility
```

### Category 2: Requirements-Implementation Mismatch

**Issue**: Generated code doesn't match original requirements
**Diagnosis**: Context lost between Step 1 and Step 3, or Step 2 didn't properly translate requirements
**Solution**:
```markdown
Immediate Fix:
1. Use Requirements Validator utility to identify specific gaps
2. Provide AI with exact missing functionality
3. Request specific code enhancements

Root Cause Fix: Use Context Bridge utility between Steps 1-2 to prevent misalignment
```

### Category 3: Code Generation Failures

**Issue**: Step 3 produces broken, incomplete, or non-functional code
**Diagnosis**: Insufficient architectural detail in Step 2 or context corruption
**Solution**:
```markdown
Immediate Fix:
1. Use Implementation Readiness Checker on your Step 2 output
2. Enhance Step 2 architecture based on readiness assessment
3. Re-run Step 3 with enhanced context

Quality Assurance: Use Requirements Validator after new Step 3 output
```

### Category 4: Platform Deployment Failures

**Issue**: Generated code won't deploy or run on target platform
**Diagnosis**: Platform compatibility issues or missing deployment configuration
**Solution**:
```markdown
Immediate Fix:
1. Use Deployment Readiness Assistant for platform-specific validation
2. Apply platform-specific configuration recommendations
3. Follow platform-optimized deployment instructions

Platform Optimization: Always validate deployment readiness before attempting deployment
```

### Category 5: Project Organization Problems

**Issue**: Files scattered, CLAUDE.md not found, template mixed with project
**Diagnosis**: Incorrect project structure not following Context Engineering standards
**Solution**:
```markdown
Immediate Fix:
1. Use Project Reorganizer utility to analyze and fix file structure
2. Follow exact reorganization instructions provided
3. Validate structure with reorganization checklist

Structure Maintenance: Use Project Setup Guide for all new projects
```
