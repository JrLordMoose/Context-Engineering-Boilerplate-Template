## Your Systematic Evolution Process

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis & Context Reconstruction

1. **Application Archaeology**:

   ```
   /analyze.current_application{
       original_requirements="Reconstruct original Step 1 requirements and vision",

   }
   ```

   **Context Reconstruction Checklist**:
   - [ ] **Original Requirements**: Core features and user stories still valid
   - [ ] **Architectural Integrity**: Current code follows original Step 2 architecture
   - [ ] **Implementation Quality**: Code quality maintained during evolution
   - [ ] **Context Engineering Compliance**: Still follows CE principles and patterns

2. **Enhancement Opportunity Assessment**:

   ```

       feature_gaps="Identify missing functionality from original vision",
       user_feedback="Analyze user needs not met by current implementation",
       technical_debt="Assess code quality and architectural improvements needed",
       competitive_analysis="Evaluate features needed for market competitiveness"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Evolution Strategy Design

3. **Enhancement Categorization**:

   ```
   /categorize.enhancements{
       new_features="Additional functionality not in original scope",
       feature_improvements="Enhancements to existing functionality", 
       architectural_evolution="Changes to system architecture or technology",
       quality_improvements="Code quality, performance, and security enhancements",
       user_experience="UI/UX improvements and usability enhancements"
   }
   ```

4. **Evolution Approach Selection**:
   - **Incremental Enhancement**: Small additions maintaining current architecture
   - **Architectural Evolution**: Significant changes requiring architecture updates
   - **Feature Expansion**: New major features requiring workflow re-execution
   - **Quality Optimization**: Performance, security, and maintainability improvements

### Phase 3: Context Engineering Re-Application

5. **Workflow Re-Execution Strategy**:

   ```
   /plan.workflow_reexecution{
       step1_revision="Whether original requirements need updating",
       step2_evolution="How architecture should evolve for new features",
       step3_enhancement="Implementation strategy for evolved application",
       context_preservation="How to maintain existing working functionality"
   }
   ```

6. **Evolution Implementation Plan**:
   - **Context Preservation**: Maintain working functionality during enhancement
   - **Incremental Delivery**: Phased approach to minimize risk
   - **Quality Maintenance**: Ensure enhancements don't degrade existing quality
   - **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing of enhanced functionality

## Evolution Scenarios

### Scenario A: Minor Feature Additions

```markdown
ðŸ”§ **Incremental Enhancement Approach**

Your enhancement goals can be achieved through incremental additions without major architectural changes.

**Enhancement Strategy**:
- **Preserve Current Architecture**: Your existing structure supports new features
- **Incremental Development**: Add features one at a time
- **Context Integration**: Use existing Context Engineering approach

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Enhanced Requirements**: Create Step 1 addendum for new features
2. **Architectural Updates**: Minor Step 2 updates for new components
3. **Targeted Implementation**: Generate specific code for new features only
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure new features work with existing code

**Recommended Approach**:
```
Mini Context Engineering Workflow for New Features:
1. Use enhanced Step 1: "Add these features to existing [app name]: [new feature list]"
2. Use enhanced Step 2: "Update architecture to support: [specific new features]"
3. Use targeted Step 3: "Generate only the new components for: [specific features]"
```

**Success Prediction**: 90%+ - Low risk enhancement with high success probability
```

### Scenario B: Significant Feature Expansion

```markdown
ðŸš€ **Architectural Evolution Approach**

Your enhancement goals require significant architectural evolution and workflow re-execution.

**Evolution Strategy**:
- **Architecture Evolution**: Current structure needs enhancement for new features
- **Systematic Re-planning**: Re-execute Step 2 with enhanced requirements
- **Coordinated Implementation**: Blend existing code with new architecture

2. **Evolved Step 2**: Redesign architecture to support both existing and new functionality
3. **Migration Step 3**: Generate enhanced application preserving existing features
4. **Validation Step 4**: Ensure all original functionality still works

**Enhanced Workflow Execution**:
```
Evolution-Optimized Context Engineering:
Step 1 Enhanced: "Evolve [existing app] to include [major new features] while preserving [existing functionality]"
Step 2 Enhanced: "Design evolved architecture supporting both current features [list] and new features [list]"  
Step 3 Enhanced: "Implement evolved application ensuring all existing functionality works plus new features"
```

**Success Considerations**: Higher complexity but systematic approach ensures quality evolution
```

### Scenario C: Complete Application Overhaul
