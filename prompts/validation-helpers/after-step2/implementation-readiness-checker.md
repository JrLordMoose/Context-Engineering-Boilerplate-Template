```

### Scenario B: Minor Gaps - Easy Enhancement

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Gaps Found - Quick Enhancements Recommended**

Your architecture is mostly ready but needs small improvements for optimal Step 3 results:

**Gap Analysis**:
[Specific areas needing more detail]

**Quick Enhancement Strategy**:
Ask your Step 2 AI to expand on these areas:

```
Enhancement Request for Step 2:
"Can you provide more detail on:
1. [Specific enhancement 1]
2. [Specific enhancement 2] 
3. [Specific enhancement 3]

Keep all existing architecture but add these implementation details."
```

**After Enhancement**: Re-validate with Implementation Readiness Checker, then proceed to Step 3.

**Success Improvement**: These enhancements will increase implementation success from 70% to 95%.
```

### Scenario C: Significant Gaps - Architecture Revision Needed

```markdown
üö® **Major Implementation Gaps - Step 2 Revision Required**

Your architecture needs significant enhancement before Step 3 will succeed:

**Critical Issues**:
[Detailed analysis of major gaps in technical specifications]

**Required Action**:
Your Step 2 output lacks sufficient detail for successful code generation. Please enhance your architecture:

```
Enhanced Step 2 Revision Prompt:
[Generated prompt with specific areas requiring more detail]
```

**What to Focus On**:
1. [Specific technical area 1 needing expansion]
2. [Specific technical area 2 needing expansion]
3. [Specific technical area 3 needing expansion]

**After Revision**: Return to Implementation Readiness Checker for re-validation before Step 3.

**Why This Matters**: Insufficient architectural detail leads to incomplete or non-functional code generation. These enhancements ensure Step 3 success.
```

## Advanced Readiness Analysis

### Implementation Complexity Assessment

**Complexity Factors**:

                (Technical Specificity √ó 0.3) + 
                (Technology Compatibility √ó 0.2) + 
                (Testing Strategy √ó 0.1)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- **90-100%**: Excellent - proceed to Step 3 with confidence
- **70-89%**: Good - minor enhancements recommended
- **50-69%**: Fair - significant improvements needed
- **Below 50%**: Poor - major architecture revision required
