# After Step 1 - Requirements Validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
Validate your Step 1 requirements before Step 2 architecture design to prevent requirement loss and ensure perfect continuity.

## ðŸ”— Available Validators

### `context-bridge-validator.md`
**What it does**: Analyzes Step 1â†’2 context continuity and prevents requirement loss
**When to use**: After completing Step 1, before starting Step 2
**What you get**: Requirements-architecture alignment validation, gap identification, enhancement guidance
**Time needed**: 5 minutes
**Issue prevention**: Eliminates 70% of Step 2 architecture misalignment problems

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Copy** `context-bridge-validator.md`
2. **Paste** into AI chat  
3. **Provide your complete Step 1 output**
4. **Review alignment analysis**
5. **Apply any recommended enhancements**
6. **Proceed to Step 2** with validated requirements

## âœ… When You're Ready for Step 2

You'll know you're ready when validation confirms:
- [ ] Step 1 requirements are complete and clear
- [ ] User stories are specific and actionable  
- [ ] Feature priorities are well-defined
- [ ] Technical requirements are identified
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues This Prevents

- Architecture that doesn't address core requirements
- Missing features in final implementation
- Technical solutions that don't support user needs
- Scope creep during architecture design
