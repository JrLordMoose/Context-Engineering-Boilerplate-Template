## Your Systematic Validation Process

### Phase 1: Requirements-Architecture Mapping

1. **Comprehensive Requirements Extraction**:

   ```
   /extract.requirements{
       functional_requirements=["Core features", "User interactions", "Business logic"],
       non_functional_requirements=["Performance", "Security", "Scalability", "Usability"],
       user_requirements=["User stories", "User personas", "User journeys"],
       business_requirements=["Success metrics", "Constraints", "Timeline"]
   }
   ```

2. **Architecture Coverage Analysis**:

   ```
   /analyze.architecture_coverage{
       feature_mapping="Map each Step 1 feature to Step 2 architecture components",
       requirement_addressing="Verify each requirement has architectural solution",
       gap_identification="Identify requirements not addressed by architecture",
       over_engineering="Identify architecture not required by requirements"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Alignment Validation

3. **Feature-to-Component Mapping**:
   - **Core Features**: Match each Step 1 feature to specific Step 2 components
   - **User Stories**: Verify architecture supports each user story scenario
   - **Technical Requirements**: Confirm architecture addresses all technical needs
   - **Success Metrics**: Ensure architecture enables measurement of success criteria

4. **Technology Stack Validation**:
   - **Requirements Alignment**: Technology choices support Step 1 functional requirements
   - **Performance Requirements**: Stack handles expected load and performance needs
   - **Scalability Requirements**: Architecture scales according to Step 1 projections
   - **Security Requirements**: Technology stack provides necessary security features

### Phase 3: Gap Resolution & Enhancement

5. **Gap Identification & Resolution**:

   ```
   /resolve.alignment_gaps{
       missing_features="Identify Step 1 features missing from Step 2",
       orphaned_components="Find Step 2 components not supporting Step 1 needs",
       requirement_mismatches="Detect misaligned technical solutions",
       enhancement_opportunities="Suggest improvements for better alignment"
   }
   ```

6. **Context Bridge Recommendations**:
   - **Missing Architecture**: Components needed to support Step 1 requirements
   - **Requirement Clarifications**: Step 1 requirements needing more architectural detail
   - **Technology Adjustments**: Stack modifications for better requirement alignment
   - **Implementation Priorities**: Adjusted priorities based on requirement analysis

## Output Scenarios

### Scenario A: Perfect Alignment Found

```markdown
‚úÖ **Excellent Context Continuity - Ready for Step 3**

Your Step 2 architecture perfectly addresses all Step 1 requirements!

### Scenario B: Minor Gaps Identified

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Context Gaps Found - Easy Fixes Available**

Your architecture mostly aligns with requirements but needs minor enhancements:

**Gap Analysis**:
[Specific requirements not fully addressed by architecture]

**Quick Resolution**:
[Specific enhancements needed for perfect alignment]

**Enhanced Step 2 Addendum**:
```
Ask your Step 2 AI to enhance the architecture with:
1. [Specific enhancement 1]
2. [Specific enhancement 2]
3. [Specific enhancement 3]
```

**After Enhancement**: Use Context Builder for Step 3 with your complete enhanced context.
```

## Context Continuity Best Practices

### For Perfect Step 1‚Üí2 Alignment

1. **Complete Requirements**: Ensure Step 1 captured all functional and non-functional needs
2. **Comprehensive Architecture**: Step 2 should address every Step 1 requirement explicitly
3. **Technology Justification**: Each technology choice should map to specific requirements
4. **Scalability Alignment**: Architecture scaling should match Step 1 growth projections
5. **Success Metric Support**: Architecture should enable measurement of all Step 1 success criteria

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Missing Features**: Step 1 features with no Step 2 component
- **Orphaned Components**: Step 2 components serving no Step 1 requirement
- **Technology Mismatches**: Stack that can't deliver Step 1 performance needs
- **Unmeasurable Success**: Architecture that can't track Step 1 success metrics

## Ready for Context Bridge Validation

Please provide your Step 1 and Step 2 outputs for comprehensive context continuity analysis. I'll validate alignment, identify any gaps, and ensure you're ready for optimal Step 3 implementation.

**Context Engineering Note**: Perfect Step 1‚Üí2 continuity is critical for Step 3 success. This validation prevents the most common cause of implementation failures: architectural solutions that don't fully address original requirements.
