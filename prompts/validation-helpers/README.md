# Validation Helpers - Quality Gates for Context Engineering Workflow

## 🎯 Purpose

These validation utilities act as **quality gates** between workflow steps, preventing 80% of common Context Engineering issues by catching problems early.

## 📁 Organization

### Before Step 1
**📋 `before-step1/`** - Optimize your readiness before requirements gathering
- `pre-flight-validator.md` - Ensure optimal Step 1 preparation and concept clarity

### After Step 1 
**🔗 `after-step1/`** - Validate requirements before architecture design
- `context-bridge-validator.md` - Ensure Step 1→2 continuity and prevent requirement loss

### After Step 2
**✅ `after-step2/`** - Validate architecture before code generation  
- `implementation-readiness-checker.md` - Ensure Step 2 completeness for successful Step 3

### After Step 3
**🎯 `after-step3/`** - Validate implementation and prepare for deployment
- `requirements-validator.md` - Verify generated code meets all original requirements
- `deployment-readiness-checker.md` - Platform-specific deployment validation and launch prep

## 🚀 How to Use

### Simple Validation Workflow
1. **Before Step 1**: Use Pre-Flight Validator to optimize requirements gathering
2. **After Step 1**: Use Context Bridge to validate Step 1→2 continuity  
3. **After Step 2**: Use Implementation Readiness to validate architecture completeness
4. **After Step 3**: Use Requirements Validator to verify code compliance
5. **Before Deployment**: Use Deployment Readiness for platform validation

### When to Use Each Validator
- **First-time users**: Use all validators for maximum success
- **Experienced users**: Use validators when you sense potential issues
- **Team projects**: Use validators at handoff points between team members
- **Complex projects**: Use all validators to prevent expensive downstream fixes

## ⚡ Quick Reference

| Validator | When to Use | What It Prevents | Time Needed |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| Pre-Flight | Before Step 1 | Weak requirements, unclear vision | 5 min |
| Context Bridge | After Step 1 | Architecture that doesn't match requirements | 5 min |
| Implementation Readiness | After Step 2 | Code generation failures | 5 min |
| Requirements Validator | After Step 3 | Code that doesn't meet original needs | 5 min |
| Deployment Readiness | Before launch | Platform compatibility issues | 5 min |

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Use sequentially**: Each validator builds on the previous validation
- **Don't skip validations**: 5 minutes of validation saves hours of debugging
- **Follow recommendations**: Validators provide specific enhancement guidance
- **Re-validate after changes**: Use validators again after making recommended improvements

**Validation Philosophy**: Catch issues early when they're easy to fix, rather than late when they're expensive to resolve.
