   - **Database Optimization**: Indexes and query optimization
   - **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching implementation
   - **Static Asset Management**: Optimization for fast loading
   - **API Performance**: Efficient endpoint implementation

### Phase 3: Deployment Configuration Generation

5. **Platform-Specific Configuration**:

   ```
   /generate.deployment_config{
       platform_optimization="Create platform-specific configuration files",
       environment_setup="Generate environment variable templates",
       build_configuration="Optimize build process for target platform",
       monitoring_setup="Configure logging and monitoring"
   }
   ```

6. **Launch Preparation Checklist**:
   - **Pre-deployment Testing**: Validation steps before launch
   - **Rollback Strategy**: Plan for deployment issues
   - **Monitoring Setup**: Observability and alerting configuration
   - **Documentation Update**: Deployment and maintenance guides
