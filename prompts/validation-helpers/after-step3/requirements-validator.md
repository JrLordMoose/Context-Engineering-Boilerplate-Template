## Implementation Validation Input

### Original Requirements Context

**Step 1 Requirements**: [Paste your complete Step 1 output with project overview, user stories, features, and requirements here]

**Step 2 Architecture**: [Paste your complete Step 2 output with system architecture, technology stack, and implementation plan here]

### Generated Implementation

**Step 3 Generated Code**: [Paste your complete Step 3 output including all generated files, code blocks, setup instructions, and documentation here]

[If any sections are empty when submitted, I'll guide you: "I need all three contexts (Step 1 requirements, Step 2 architecture, and Step 3 generated code) to perform comprehensive requirements validation. Please provide the missing sections for complete analysis."]

## Your Systematic Validation Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Traceability Analysis

1. **Functional Requirements Mapping**:

   ```
   /map.functional_requirements{
       step1_features="Extract all features and functionality from Step 1",
       step3_implementation="Identify corresponding implementation in generated code",
       coverage_analysis="Determine implementation completeness for each requirement",
       gap_identification="Identify requirements not implemented in code"
   }
   ```

   **Feature Implementation Matrix**:
   | Step 1 Requirement | Expected Implementation | Found in Code | Status | Notes |
   |-------------------|------------------------|---------------|--------|-------|
   | [Auto-generated traceability matrix] |||||

2. **User Story Implementation Validation**:

   ```
   /validate.user_stories{
       story_breakdown="Analyze each user story from Step 1",
       implementation_paths="Trace how each story is implemented in code",
       user_flow_verification="Verify complete user journeys are possible",
       missing_functionality="Identify user stories not fully implemented"
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Architectural Compliance Assessment

3. **Architecture Alignment Check**:

   ```
   /verify.architectural_alignment{
       planned_components="Components specified in Step 2 architecture",
       implemented_components="Components found in Step 3 code",
       structure_compliance="File structure matches Step 2 plan",
       technology_consistency="Technology usage aligns with Step 2 choices"
   }
   ```

4. **Technical Specification Compliance**:
   - **Database Schema**: Generated models match Step 2 specifications
   - **API Endpoints**: Implementation matches planned API design
   - **Component Architecture**: Code structure follows Step 2 component plan
   - **Technology Usage**: Frameworks and libraries used as specified

### Phase 3: Implementation Quality Analysis

5. **Code Completeness Assessment**:

   ```
   /assess.implementation_completeness{
       core_functionality="All primary features fully implemented",
       error_handling="Robust error management and validation",
       security_implementation="Authentication and authorization present",
       testing_coverage="Adequate test coverage for requirements",
       documentation_quality="Setup and usage documentation complete"
   }
   ```

6. **Production Readiness Evaluation**:
   - **Configuration Management**: Environment setup and configuration files
   - **Deployment Preparation**: Build scripts and deployment instructions
   - **Performance Considerations**: Optimization and scalability implementations
   - **Monitoring and Logging**: Observability and debugging capabilities

- [Small enhancements needed for full compliance]

**Quick Fix Strategy**:
Ask your Step 3 AI to enhance the code:

```
Enhancement Request:
"The generated code is excellent but needs these specific additions:
1. [Specific missing functionality 1]
2. [Specific missing functionality 2]
3. [Specific missing functionality 3]

Please add these to the existing codebase without changing the current structure."
```

**After Enhancement**: Re-validate with Requirements Validator to confirm full compliance.

**Quality Score**: 85-95% - Very good implementation with minor enhancement opportunities
```
