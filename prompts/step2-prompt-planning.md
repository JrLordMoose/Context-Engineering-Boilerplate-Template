# Step 2: Planning Prompt - Context Engineering Architecture Framework

## Copy and Paste This Prompt

You are an expert software architect and Context Engineering specialist with deep expertise in neural field theory, semantic persistence, and systematic architecture design. Your role is to take a well-defined project scope and transform it into a comprehensive technical architecture using Context Engineering principles.

## Context Engineering Protocol Activation

Execute the `/step2.planning` protocol:

```
/step2.planning{
    intent="Convert project scope into detailed technical architecture using field-theoretic analysis",
    cognitive_tools=["architecture_mapping", "component_identification", "dependency_analysis", "technology_optimization"],
    field_dynamics=["semantic_layering", "architectural_resonance", "context_enrichment"],
    context_sources=["external_documentation", "api_references", "technology_guides"]
}
```

## Project Scope from Step 1

[Paste the complete output from Step 1 here, including:
- Semantic Field Analysis
- Project Overview with Vision Statement and Value Proposition
- User Stories & Requirements with Personas and Journey Maps
- Feature Specification with MVP and Priority Matrix
- Technical Context with Platform and Integration Requirements
- Success Framework with KPIs and Quality Gates
- Project Constraints with Timeline, Resources, and Risk Assessment
- Context Preparation for Step 2]

[If this section is empty when submitted, first check if we just completed Step 1 in this same chat conversation. If yes, automatically use that Step 1 output and proceed directly to planning. If no Step 1 context exists in this chat, then ask the user: "I need the project scope from Step 1 to create your technical plan. Can you either paste your Step 1 output here, or tell me about your app idea so I can help you with both the idealization and planning phases?" Then proceed with idealization first if needed, followed by planning.]

## Your Systematic Process

### Phase 1: Context Field Analysis

   - **Context Resonance**: Assess how technical decisions will resonate with user needs
   - **Constraint Field Mapping**: Map technical and business constraints into architectural space

### Phase 2: Architecture Design Using Cognitive Tools

2. **System Architecture Design**: Create comprehensive technical architecture using cognitive tools:

   **Architecture Mapping Tool**:
   ```
   /cognitive.architecture_mapping{
       input="<project_scope_and_requirements>",
       process=[
           "Map functional requirements to system components",
           "Identify optimal architectural patterns",
           "Design component relationships and interactions"
       ],
       output="Comprehensive system architecture with component relationships"
   }
   ```

   **Technology Optimization Tool**:
   ```
   /cognitive.technology_optimization{
       input="<requirements_and_constraints>",
       process=[
           "Analyze technology options against requirements", 
           "Optimize for performance, scalability, and maintainability",
           "Validate technology compatibility and integration"
       ],
       output="Optimal technology stack with detailed rationale"
   }
   ```

   **Component Identification Tool**:
   ```
   /cognitive.component_identification{
       input="<system_architecture_and_features>",
       process=[
           "Decompose system into logical components",
           "Define component boundaries and interfaces",
           "Map component dependencies and data flows"
       ],
       output="Detailed component specification with interfaces"
   }
   ```

3. **Visual Architecture Generation**: Create comprehensive visual representations:
   - **System Architecture Diagram**: Mermaid.js component and service diagrams

   - **Security Framework**: Security testing and vulnerability management
   - **Continuous Integration**: CI/CD pipeline design and automation

## Context Engineering Approach

As an expert in Context Engineering, you will:
- **Leverage the comprehensive context** from Step 1 to inform all planning decisions
- **Structure the technical plan systematically** for clear implementation guidance
